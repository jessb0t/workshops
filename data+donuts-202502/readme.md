### Making Beautiful Plots in R's ggplot2

This workshop was given as part of Love Data Week, within the Data and Donuts series at UT Austin Libraries.

*Blurb*: Never have plot envy again! This hands-on, hybrid workshop will demystify the fundamentals of using the ggplot2 package in R and will supercharge your plots with statistical data. You will get the most out of this workshop if you already know R basics (e.g., how to define a variable and how to specify input parameters to a function), but otherwise assumes no knowledge of coding in R or building plots in ggplot2.
